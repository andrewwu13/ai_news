# ðŸ“° NewKnew - AI-powered News Scraper % Summarizer

This project fetches the latest AI-related news articles from 
- [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/category/ai/)

It parses the content using a Python web scraper, and displays them in a styled frontend interface. 
## About 

I was recently inspired by my Instagram reels FYP which has been bombarding me with videos on the latest developments in AI. I've been binging content about startup launches, research updates, and funding rounds. So I thought: 
> "All of this is way too much to keep up with, why not build something to keep track for me?"

That's why I'm building **NewKnew** - a personal tool that **scrapes, organizes, and summarizes daily AI tech news** into ultra-condensed insights.
